description: '"5K Schedule 3: 60 to 70 Miles (94-111 km) per Week" from "Faster Road
  Racing: 5K to Half Marathon" by Pete D. Pfitzinger and Philip Latter. "This schedule
  is for runners who have been training 55 to 65 miles per week. If you have been
  running fewer than 55 miles per week, you should follow the base-training schedule
  in chapter 8 for building up to 60 miles per week before attempting this schedule,
  which starts at 60 miles per week and gradually builds up to 70 miles with three
  weeks to go before your goal race. The training then tapers so you are fit and refreshed
  for race day."'
