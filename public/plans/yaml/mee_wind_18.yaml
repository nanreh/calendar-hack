description: |-
  "The Wind plan reaches high enough mileage to support more varied and sophisticated workouts during all phases of training. It's a great choice if you're looking to get serious about your marathon training, but aren't yet ready for the time commitment and stress on your body that comes along with higher-volume plans. Wind is a great fit if you are aiming for a new personal record, looking to qualify for Boston, or have two or more years of experience." - Marathon Excellence for Everyone by John Davis
