  "If you have ambitious goals in the marathon and want to step up your training, Gale is a great choice. The Gale plan sits at a sweet spot for many runners: enough volume to get great performance returns, but not so much that you're doubling every single day. Gale is a great fit if you are aiming for a significant PR, making subsequent attempts at qualifying for Boston or other major-city races, or if you have three or more years of experience." - Marathon Excellence for Everyone by John Davis
