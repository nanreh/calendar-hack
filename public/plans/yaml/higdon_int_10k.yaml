description: "Hal Higdon: 10K Intermediate: \"This is the Intermediate 10K
  Training Program, for runners who want to improve their performances. What
  defines an Intermediate runner? You should be running five to six times a week,
  averaging 15-25 miles weekly training. You probably also should have run a half
  dozen or more races at distances between the 5K and the Half-Marathon. With
  that as background, you now need a somewhat more sophisticated schedule to
  improve. \"
