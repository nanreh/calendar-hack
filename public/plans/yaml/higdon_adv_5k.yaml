description: "Hal Higdon: 5K Advanced: \"If you are a seasoned veteran of the
  running wars, an individual who has been running for several years and who has
  run numerous 5K races and races at other distances, there comes a time when you
  want to seek maximum performance. Regardless of your age or ability, you would
  like to run as fast as you possibly can. You want a training program that will
  challenge you. Here it is! Advanced 5K is aimed, first, at runners who want to
  train fast but short, whose main focus is on short-distance races. But the
  program also is useful as a prelude to a more endurance-based program aimed at
  a full or half marathon. Thus, Advanced 5K is a specialty program, useful for
  your improvement as a runner. \"
