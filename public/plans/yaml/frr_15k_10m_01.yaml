description: '"This schedule is for runners who have been training 25 to 35 miles per week. If you have been running fewer than 25 miles per week, follow the base-training schedule in chapter 8 for building up to 30 miles per week before attempting this schedule. This schedule starts at 31 miles per week and gradually builds up to 45 miles with three weeks to go before your goal race. The training then tapers so you are fit and refreshed for race day."'
