name: 'Faster Road Racing: Base Building Schedule 2'
description: '"Base Training 2: Building up to 45 Miles (72 km) per Week" from "Faster Road
  Racing: 5K to Half Marathon" by Pete D. Pfitzinger and Philip Latter. "This schedule
  is for runners who have been training 25 to 35 miles per week. If you have been
  running fewer than 25 miles per week, you should follow the training schedule for
  building up to 30 miles per week outlined in chapter 8 before attempting this schedule.
  The schedule starts at 30 miles per week and gradually builds up to 40 miles with
  three weeks to go before your goal race. The training then tapers so you are fit
  and refreshed for race day."'
