  "The Breeze plan is a low-mileage plan designed for newer marathoners who are still learning the ropes of marathon training and racing. The Breeze plan has modest time requirements and features less-challenging workouts than the higher-mileage Marathon Excellence plans. Breeze is a great fit for first-time marathoners, injury-prone runners, weekend warriors, and runners with less than two years of experience." - Marathon Excellence for Everyone by John Davis
