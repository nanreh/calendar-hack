description: |-
  "The Tornado plan uses sophisticated workouts throughout all phases of training to help you reach your full potential in the marathon. It's definitely a demanding plan, both in terms of time and stress on your body, but the reward is a superior fitness level. Tornado is a great fit for runners who do well on high-mileage training and have four or more years of experience, as well as for runners aiming for a big breakthrough or a significant PR, targeting a podium finish, or competing in the elite field." - Marathon Excellence for Everyone by John Davis
